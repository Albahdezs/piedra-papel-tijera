# Rules 📓

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple hand game usually played by two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand:

- Rock (✊),
- Paper (✋),
- Scissors (✌).

The rules are:

- Rock beats Scissors (Rock crushes Scissors).
- Scissors beats Paper (Scissors cut Paper).
- Paper beats Rock (Paper covers Rock).

If both players choose the same shape, it’s a tie. The game is usually played in multiple rounds, and the first player to win a set number of rounds wins the game.
